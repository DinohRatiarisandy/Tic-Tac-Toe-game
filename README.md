# How to play it ?
You can download the main.py file and then launch it. But first, you need to have Python installed on your machine, as well as the Pygame module. </br>
Then, to start, player 1 (yellow) begins the game, followed by player 2 (pink), and the game continues to alternate like this until one of them is defeated or the game ends in a draw.
